GTK WordNet browser
=====================

Simple gtk+ interface for Princeton WordNet dictionary. See
http://wordnet.princeton.edu for details.

The main reason for this app is that original WordNet client is Tcl/Tk
based. So it integrates with GNOME poorly and looks somewhat
outdated. I know, one can view WordNet with GNOME Dictionary via
dictd, but the output is cluttered and not as usable as with original
client.


Requirements
============

gnome-common >= 2.28.0
glib >= 2.28.0
gtk+ >= 2.24.4
libwordnet >= 3.0


TODO
====

* shortcuts (CTR+L, CTR+Q) and menu
* store window size hints
* history?
* icon?
